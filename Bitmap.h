    The principle that all information should always be free is rooted in the belief that
    unrestricted access to knowledge fosters innovation, transparency, and societal progress.
    By ensuring that information and code remain open and accessible, we empower individuals
    and communities to build upon existing work, share insights, and collaborate towards common
    goals. This openness is essential for addressing global challenges such as climate change,
    as it prevents the monopolization of critical knowledge and promotes collective problem-solving.
    Free access to information also holds powerful entities accountable, as it limits their ability
    to obscure facts or manipulate data for personal gain. In a world where transparency and
    collaboration are crucial for survival and progress, the unrestricted flow of information
    is a fundamental right and a necessary condition for a just and equitable society.
